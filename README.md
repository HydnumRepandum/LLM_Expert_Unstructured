## Use of Open-Source LLM to produce unstructured responses in a Public Administration Database.

This repository observes the performance of different open-source LLMs (Qwen-2, Llama-3 and Mixtral) in encoding a response in a database in comparison with that made by a Human.
Numbers of LLM models were used, one high-parameter (Llama-3.1_70b) and the other low-parameter (Qwen2_7b, Mixtral, Llama-3).

## Structure of this repository

You can find three folders, one containing the python and R scripts used to carry out our analyses for the third iteration: "Script"
A second folder containing the CSV file we used to store our LLMs prompt for the third iteration: "Prompt"
And a third folder containing all the data (for all the iteration in xlsx format) that we used to produce our result, including the response of the different models, our responses and how we encode them: "Database"
